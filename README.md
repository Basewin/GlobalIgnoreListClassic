This version adds functionality to allow for the filtering of ignored players only on specific channels and event types.

Examples would be:
> You only want to filter chat for players in a channel named "LookingForGroup".

> You only want to filter whispers (add the event type name "CHAT_MSG_WHISPER").

> You want to do both of the above examples.

Also Added:
> Bypass toggle for channel and event filters.

> Group/raid invite toggle.

The new configurable fields are in the "Options" tab in the Global Ignore List options panel.

Mouse-over the edit box field for a tooltip with instructions:
> "Enter a list of channel names (LFG, LookingForGroup, etc) and event types (CHAT_MSG_WHISPER, CHAT_MSG_PARTY, etc) to ignore, separated by semi-colons. Leave blank to ignore all channels and types (use default behavior)."
