This version adds functionality to allow for the filtering of ignored players only on specific channels and event types.

Examples would be:
> You only want to filter chat for players in a channel named "LookingForGroup".
> You only want to filter whispers for players (add the event type name "CHAT_MSG_WHISPER").
> You want to do both of the above examples.


The new configurable field is on the "Options" tab in the Global Ignore List options panel.  The name is:
"Ignore only these channel names and events"

Mouse-over the edit box field for a tooltip with instructions:
> "Enter a list of channel names (LFG, LookingForGroup, etc)\nor event types (CHAT_MSG_WHISPER, CHAT_MSG_PARTY, etc)\nto ignore separated by semi-colons.\n\nLeave blank to ignore all channels and types (use default behavior)."
